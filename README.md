The goal of this task was to build a simple, interactive Java program that helps users manage text files. The program allows you to create a new file, write text into it, read the contents, or add more text later. It's like a basic notepad built with Java, but it runs in the terminal.

The user interacts with a menu where they just choose a number to perform an action—like creating a file, writing to it, or reading what's inside. After each action, the program shows what’s in the file so the user knows exactly what happened.
